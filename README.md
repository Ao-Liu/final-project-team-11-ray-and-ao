# Recipe Run
        
## Project Description
This web application is designed for all cooking enthusiasts or speedrun lovers and is expected to spread quickly among their circle of friends. The users of this app may be those who cook for fun, entertainment, or competition, or those who merely want something to decide for them what to eat. When the app is ready for commercial operation, we will hold an official recipe run contest, which will offer a cash price to the winner of each run.

  - Frontend: React (frontend framework) + AntDesign (React UI library)
